There is a highly signicant result between them. However, somewhat puzzling, there is not between pc use and the wage gap in this educational group, which I included as a check. \n\nthere is however also a signicant but somewhat smaller correlation between the instrument and the wage gap, which is not a good sign. \n\n\nregressing the instrument and the controls on the pc use variable, we get a signicant result, meaning that the instrument does predict pc use. \n\n``` {r,  echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n\n\n\nj1[, .(pcemp_m_c2000, lncs1980, dmfwg28)] %>% dtcor() \nfeols(pcemp_m_c2000 ~ lncs1980 + durmf1980 + nondmf1980, data = j1, vcov='hetero') %>% etable()\n\n\n```\n\nThe hauseman test, showing the validity of the IV approach, is also signicant (it's prinited at the end of the output.)\n\n\n\n\n``` {r,  echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nq3b  \n```\n\nAll in all, I conclude that the IV approach seems to be valid, but the correlation between the instrument and the wage gap in the primary model is concerning.\n\n#### q3.d\n\n\nfirst the IV model, next to the naive ols model and the previous IV model with only one instrument.
