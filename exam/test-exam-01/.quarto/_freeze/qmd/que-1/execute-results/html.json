We might suspect that there are other factors at play that leads a company to establish a headquarter in the US, so that the more succesfull firms will try their luck in the US. Thus, the bias should be positive. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell tbl-cap='q1.e'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nt.test(total_raised ~ us_hq, data = f1, alternative = \"two.sided\", var.equal = FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n\tWelch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  total_raised by us_hq\nt = -8.7109, df = 179.13, p-value = 1.969e-15\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 0 and group 1 is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -29.87283 -18.83823\nsample estimates:\nmean in group 0 mean in group 1 \n       7.121927       31.477460 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n#### q1.f\n\n\nthe dummy it_software is chosen as the reference for industry, since it is a high-profile industry. \n\nRobust standard errors are used, under the assumption that the observations will most likely be heteroskedastic, in almost all real life scenarios. (as a side: this does not change the rejection of any parameters under H0) \n\nwe see that us_hq is significant, so that total VC raised is higher for firms with a US headquarter.\n\nwe see that the number of founders are significant, so that total VC raised is 0.17 million higher for each additional founder, everything else in the model being equal.\n\nso is prior number of success start ups by the founding team, which might be interpreted as a mix of experience and ability of the team.\n\nwe see that the life sciences and medical industry is not significant, so that these are not statistically different from the IT industry. This makes sense, as both of these are high profile industries, and one would expect them to fare good, just as the high-profile industry of IT. \n\n\nThe dummy for communication tech and internet are significantly negative compared to the IT industry, which is somewhat surprising - I do not posses a lot of knowledge about the difference between these.\n\n[not finished - just a lot of blah blah that shows I know how to interpret an OLs] \n\n\n::: {.cell tbl-cap='q1.f'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfeols(ln_raised ~ us_hq + n_founders + prof + n_ssfp + cleantech + comms +  internet + life_science + medical_dev + semicond + misc, data = f1, vcov='hetero') \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nOLS estimation, Dep.
